## Bootstrapping
The simplest way to run the bootstrapping script is to `curl` it and pipe it to `bash` in Terminal. Alternatively, you can save it from Github into a file and run that, especially if you want to see what's in it, first.

Because this is my personal stuff, and I know what's in the shell script, I'm fine with just running the curl command:

```
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AutumnMageKate/Dotfiles/master/bootstrap.bash)
```
